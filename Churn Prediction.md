- Churn is also known as customer turnover. It represents the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. Businesses often use customer churn analysis and prediction to identify the risk of customers cancelling their subscriptions and implement strategies to reduce them. This can involve improving customer service, offering incentives or discounts, personalizing marketing efforts, or addressing specific pain points that lead to customer dissatisfaction.

- This file offers a demonstartion of a question posted at Lux Tech academy data science bootcamp.   "Imagine you're working with Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA.  They're really keen on figuring out how many customers might decide to leave them in the  coming months. Luckily, they've got a bunch of past data about when customers have left > before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things like that. So, if you were in charge of predicting customer churn how would you go about using machine learning to make a good guess about which customers might leave? Like, what steps would you take to create a machine learning model that can predict if someone's going to leave or not?"
-  In order to guess which customers might leave in the near future, I'd create a machine learning model to predict such occurences. 



##  1. Prepare the Data

- The sprint company has got past records of when customers left as well as info of who they were. This includes : 1.Billing information 2. customer demographics and any other relevant features. Resolving any formatting problems is the first thing.
Data comes from different sources and sometimes the format isn't matching. Transform and aggregate where necessary using ETL methods.
- After acquiring the data, I'll proceed to cleaning it by basically identifying any missing values. If the dataset is large, it'll be okay to drop down the missing rows. However, if I want acurate results,
then taking the mean value of particular columns and fill the empty respective rows with the mean values.
- Variable encoding is also  necessary sometimes, where categorical variables are transformed to numerical.
- Further cleaning by splitting the data into training and testing sets.

##  2. Data exploration and Analysis
To understand the various relationships between variables and see if the data is appropriate. Finding out what are the datatypes in each column or what are the mean, mode, max and min values of each column.
Using visualization techniques like histograms and box plots to identify patterns and trends that have been going on to come up with ideas of solving my problem.
## 3 Feature selection and Engineering
Select relevant features that are likely to impact churn. This may include customer demographics, contract details, usage metrics, and customer service interactions.
Create new features if necessary, such as churn probability scores, customer tenure, or customer lifetime value.
## 4 Model Planning and training
First and foremost, Churn prediction is a binary classification problem. The possible models to be used are logistic regression, decision trees and random forests. I'll experiment with the different  algorithms and hyperparameters to identify the best-performing model. 
- Train the selected model on the training data.
- Monitor and optimize the training process by adjusting hyperparameters and addressing overfitting or underfitting issues.The best model is what will proceed.
## 5 Model evaluation
The next step is to evaluate the model using appropriate metrics like precision, recall and F1-score.
## 6 Model deployment
- Next is to deploy the trained model into a production environment, where it can make real-time predictions on new customer data.
- Also implementing a monitoring system to continuously assess the model's performance and retrain it periodically with updated data.
## 7 Communication of the results
Having the results, the next step is to communicate to the stakeholders which is basically like taking the results and preparing a presentation or a dashboard and communicating the results to the team that gave me the problem.
Explain the findings of that exerciseand recommend what steps they need to take inorder to overcome the churn problem.
## 8 Keep tabs
Continuously collect feedback from the stakeholders , any team members and customer interactions to improve the model's accuracy and relevance over time.
